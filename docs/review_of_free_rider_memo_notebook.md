Review of “Free-Rider Collective Intelligence in

Memo DSL” Notebook

## Clarity and Readability of Analysis and Narrative

The   notebook   is   structured   with   clear   section   headings   and   a   logical   flow   from   research   question   to

technical approach, analysis, and conclusions. The  key question  and  technical approach  are stated up

front, which helps the reader understand the context immediately. Defining the three agent types (Intrinsic,

Free Rider, Opt-Out) early on is also helpful. However, some aspects of the narrative could be clearer:

Explanation of Terms:  The notebook references the  Memo DSL  and “proven patterns from Memo

knowledge   collection”   without   explanation.   Readers   unfamiliar   with   Memo   may   not   grasp   that

Memo is a domain-specific probabilistic programming language for reasoning about reasoning

.

A brief introduction to Memo (perhaps with a citation to its documentation or paper) would improve

clarity.

Use of Markdown vs. Prints: Much of the narrative is delivered via  print  statements with emoji

bullets (e.g. “  Key Finding: ...”). While this adds a visual cue and keeps the flow interactive, it means

the commentary is embedded in code output. For readability and for static views of the notebook,

consider moving these explanations into markdown cells. This would ensure the analysis is visible

even without executing the notebook, and it allows more descriptive, full-sentence interpretation of

results rather than terse bullet phrases.

Transitions and Explanations:  Each analysis subsection (participation, bias & accuracy, theory-of-

mind, etc.) is structured and labeled, which is good. To further enhance readability, add one or two

sentences in markdown interpreting the output of each code section. For example, after printing

participation rates, explicitly state  “Intrinsic contributors participated in 76% of opportunities without

incentives vs 86% with incentives, whereas free riders participated only 23% without incentives, jumping to

63% with incentives. This indicates free riders are far more responsive to incentives.”  Such context links

the numeric results back to the research question in prose, reinforcing understanding.

Avoiding Jargon: Some phrases like “hybrid architecture achieving proven reliability patterns” come

off as jargon. If specific “proven patterns” exist, it would help to explain or cite them. Otherwise,

simpler language can be used. For instance, clarify that the notebook uses Memo for probabilistic

components and Python for control flow, combining them to model the scenario. In general, the

narrative should favor clear explanation over buzzwords.

On   the   whole,   the   notebook   is   relatively   easy   to   follow,   but   integrating   the   explanatory   text   more

seamlessly with the results and providing additional context (especially about Memo) would enhance clarity

and reader engagement.

Accuracy and Depth of Interpretation (Relative to Reference

Papers)

The notebook captures the major findings of Tchernichovski et al. (2023)

and attempts to interpret

them through a cognitive lens. It correctly reflects several key results from the free_rider study:

Free   Riders’   Higher   Accuracy:  The   notebook   emphasizes   that   participants   who   free-rode

(contributed ratings infrequently) had higher individual accuracy in their evaluations than those who

rated frequently. This aligns with the paper’s finding that incentivized (previously less motivated)

participants achieved significantly higher within-subject accuracy (e.g. R² ≈ 0.44 in influenced vs 0.20
. The values used in the notebook (R² = 0.46 for free riders
in uninfluenced in one experiment)

vs 0.29 for intrinsic) are reasonable representations of this phenomenon, though they do not exactly

match a single reported statistic. They seem to be an average of different experimental conditions

(for instance, another experiment saw R² ≈ 0.47 vs 0.34 for low-frequency vs high-frequency raters
). It would strengthen accuracy to cite the source of these numbers or use the exact values from
one   condition   for   consistency.   Nonetheless,   the   qualitative   point   stands:   free   riders   were   more

accurate,   which   the   notebook   correctly   highlights   as   a   “paradox”   that   more  inactive  members

provided better information.

Bias   Direction   and   Quality:  The   notebook   notes   that  intrinsic   participants   had   a   positive   bias

(overestimating) about 80% of the time, whereas free riders had an 80% negative bias (underestimation).

This reflects the paper’s observation that frequent raters tended to give higher ratings on average (a

positive bias), possibly due to a “lazy” high-rating strategy or prosocial leniency

, while the less

frequent raters gave lower scores (negative bias) which correlated with greater accuracy

. The

use of 80% as the bias rate is a bit generic – the source article indicates a strong bias difference but

doesn’t   explicitly   state   “80%”   in   text.   If   this   figure   comes   from   a   specific   analysis   (perhaps   a

supplemental figure), citing that would improve depth. The important point, though, is accurately

captured:  bias is inversely related to accuracy, and free riders’ tendency to be critical (negative)

contributed to their better performance

.

Incentive   Effects   on   Participation:  The   notebook   correctly   shows   that   introducing   incentives

dramatically increased free riders’ participation (+40 percentage points in the notebook, from 23% to

63%,  vs  only  +10  points  for  intrinsic  agents).  This  aligns  with  the  paper’s  finding  that  incentives

“increased participation by about 30%” overall with no adverse side effects

, and specifically that it

reduced the proportion of free-riders in the group from 23% down to 10%

. In other words, many

previously reluctant participants began contributing when incentivized. The exact numbers in the

notebook (23% → 63% for free riders) appear to be illustrative; the paper’s meta-analysis suggests
. It might
free-riders largely stopped free-riding (a reduction to 10% incidence) under incentives

be more precise to say  free riders’ contribution frequency roughly doubled or tripled with incentives,

rather than quoting specific percentages without reference. Including a citation to the figure or text

confirming   free   riders’   increased   contributions   would   add   credibility.   Overall,   the   direction   and

magnitude of the effect are portrayed correctly: free riders are much more responsive to incentives

than intrinsically motivated contributors

.

Collective   Benefit   of   Diversity:  The   notebook   concludes   that   a   mixed   group   of   participants

(intrinsic   +   free-riders)   outperforms   a   homogeneous   group   of   only   intrinsic   (high-participation)

members – shown as 85% vs 60% performance in the toy calculation (a 25% “diversity benefit”). This

reflects   the   core   message   of   the   PNAS   paper,   which   argued   that   systems   composed   solely   of

intrinsically   motivated   (prosocial)   contributors   may  underperform,   and   that   adding   those   with

different motivation (free riders incentivized to participate) can improve collective outcomes

.

The paper demonstrated that when incentives brought in the less motivated participants, the overall

accuracy of the crowd’s ratings  increased, speeding up learning in the collective task

. The

notebook’s numbers (85% vs 60%) are not explicitly from the paper (which did not report a single

“performance   percentage”   metric   in   that   form),   but   they   illustrate   the   qualitative   advantage   of

diversity.   To   be   rigorous,   the   notebook   could   reference   a   specific   result   –   for   example,  “in   one

experiment, pooled rating accuracy increased from 0.20 to 0.44 when free riders were included

”  –

rather than using abstract “performance” percentages. Still, the interpretation that heterogeneous

groups achieved better collective intelligence is faithful to the authors’ findings.

Where the notebook’s interpretation could be improved or made more nuanced is in the  explanation of

mechanisms:

Cognitive Mechanism vs. Bias: The notebook frames free riders as having a “strategic” advantage

and even implies a theory-of-mind difference (e.g. free riders “understand” that selective participation

signals quality, while intrinsic agents trust frequent contributors). This is an interesting hypothesis

but goes beyond what the PNAS study demonstrated. Tchernichovski et al. attributed free riders’

superior accuracy largely to  bias differences  and possibly personality traits, rather than deliberate

strategic reasoning. They note that a  social bias  (the tendency of intrinsically motivated people to

rate positively, perhaps out of a “moral licensing” or lazy heuristic) rather than cognitive skill explains

the   accuracy   gap

.   In   fact,   they   found   rating   accuracy   was  negatively  correlated   with   a

measure of altruism, suggesting the less altruistic (or less prosocially motivated) individuals were

more   hard-nosed   and   accurate

.   The   notebook’s   theory-of-mind   interpretation   (different

“reliability   models”   between   agent   types)   is   intriguing,   but   it   should   be   flagged   as   a   speculative

inference   consistent   with   the   data,   not   a   confirmed   finding   from   the   paper.   If   the   goal   is   to

incorporate   insights   from   the  memo  framework,   one   might   explicitly   cite   how  memo  enables
modeling agents’ beliefs about others (e.g. via the   thinks   construct for nested reasoning

).

Currently, the notebook implies such cognitive modeling without actually demonstrating it. To align

with   the   source   material,   the   authors   could   clarify   that   the   theory-of-mind   points   are   their

conceptual   explanation   built   on   the   empirical   findings,   rather   than   something   the   original

experiment directly proved. Mentioning that Tchernichovski et al. pointed to bias (and even ruled out

some cognitive factors) as the mediator

would show a balanced understanding.

Missing Nuances: The notebook focuses on the primary results, but there are additional nuances in

the papers that aren’t discussed. For example, the PNAS study looked at removing the incentive after

introducing it, finding that when incentives were withdrawn, the previously influenced participants’

output dropped in quantity but their accuracy remained high (no reversion in quality)

. This

supports the idea that it was the inclusion of those high-accuracy individuals that mattered, not the

incentive per se changing how accurately people rated. Also, personality analysis suggested traits

like low altruism correlated with accuracy

. A more in-depth analysis might mention these points

to demonstrate deeper engagement with the paper’s content. Similarly, the  memo_paper.pdf  likely

introduces Memo’s capabilities (like modeling classic games, nested reasoning scenarios, etc.

),

but the notebook doesn’t explicitly draw on a specific example from it. Citing or emulating a small

relevant example (for instance, using Memo to model a simple game-theoretic scenario or a Bayes

update)  could  deepen  the  methodological  connection  to  the  Memo  framework.  As  it  stands,  the

notebook’s   depth   of   interpretation   of   the  free_rider  paper   is   good   for   core   findings,   but   it   could

acknowledge   these   subtleties   and   additional   evidence   from   the   references   to   provide   a   more

comprehensive picture.

In summary, the notebook is  accurate in its portrayal of the high-level findings: incentives recruit free

riders, who bring negative biases and high accuracy, thereby improving collective performance

. To

improve, it should ensure that its more speculative explanations (like theory-of-mind reasoning differences)

are   framed   in   context   of   the   evidence   and   possibly   supported   by   Memo’s   conceptual   toolkit.   Including

precise citations or data points from the papers would bolster the credibility and depth of the analysis.

## Visualization Quality and Interpretability

The notebook includes several simple visualizations (bar charts) to illustrate the findings. Overall, these

figures are clear and serve to reinforce the comparisons discussed in text:

Participation   Rates   Chart:  A   grouped   bar   chart   shows   base   vs.   incentivized   participation   for

Intrinsic and Free Rider agents. The axes are labeled (“Participation Rate”) and each bar group is

clearly identified by agent type, with a legend distinguishing base vs with-incentive conditions. This

effectively   highlights   the   modest   increase   for   Intrinsic   vs   the   large   jump   for   Free   Riders.   One

suggestion here is to annotate the bars with their exact values or percentage increase, since the

text prints those values anyway. For example, adding data labels like “+10%” above the intrinsic bar

increase and “+40%” above the free rider increase (or simply labeling the ends of bars with 76%, 86%,

etc.) would make the visualization self-contained. Nonetheless, the color coding and layout make the

point   evident:   free   riders’   orange   bar   (with   incentive)   towers   above   their   baseline,   whereas   the

intrinsic bars are closer together.

Incentive   Boost   Chart:  Adjacent   to   the   above,   a   bar   chart   of   “Incentive   Boost”   by   agent   type

succinctly   shows   the   direct   comparison   of   +0.10   vs   +0.40.   The   y-axis   (“Incentive   Boost”)   and   the

choice of a smaller range (0 to 0.5) focuses attention on the difference. The use of distinct colors

(skyblue for one and orange for the other) differentiates the bars, but since only two categories are

present,  a  single-color  scheme  with  value  labels  might  suffice  too.  The  current  approach  is  fine;

viewers can see at a glance that the Free Rider bar is roughly 4× the Intrinsic bar. If anything, adding

the numeric boost values on top of these bars would precisely quantify that gap (e.g. “+0.40” above

the Free Rider bar).

Bias  and  Accuracy  Charts:  The  notebook  cleverly  uses  color  to  indicate  bias  direction  –  red  for

positive bias (Intrinsic) and blue for negative bias (Free Rider) – in the left subplot, and uses different

pastel colors for the accuracy bars on the right. The bias plot includes text annotations (“Positive

(overestimate)” and “Negative (underestimate)”) positioned above each bar, which is a nice touch for

interpretability. One minor concern: the text is hard-coded at y=0.85, which works given the bars are

at 0.8 height, but if the values changed the text might overlap. It appears fine here. The accuracy

subplot has a clear y-axis label (“Individual Accuracy (R²)”) and indicates the substantial difference

between agent types. To improve these plots:

Ensure consistency in color usage: the intrinsic agent is red-tinted in bias and light-coral in accuracy,

while the free rider is blue in bias and light-blue in accuracy. This is mostly consistent (warm color for

intrinsic, cool for free rider), but a legend or note could help if a reader doesn’t infer that mapping.

Alternatively, using the same two colors in both subplots (red vs blue) would tie bias and accuracy

together by agent type.

Adding the R² values as labels on the accuracy bars (e.g. “0.29” and “0.46”) would reinforce the

numeric difference.

If   data   were   being   drawn   from   an   experiment   with   variance,   error   bars   or   confidence   intervals

should be shown. Since these are fixed illustrative values, acknowledging in a caption that these are

representative means without uncertainty is okay.

Collective   Performance   Chart:  This   final   bar   chart   contrasts   a   “Homogeneous”   population’s

performance   with   a   “Mixed”   population.   The   use   of   lightgray   vs   gold   makes   the   two   bars

distinguishable.  The  y-axis  “Collective  Performance”  is  a  bit  vague  –  it  might  be  clearer  if  it  said

something   like   “Collective   Success   Rate”   or   whatever   the   metric   is   (e.g.   “Proportion   of   optimal

decisions”). In context, we know it means overall outcome quality, but defining it would help. The

title highlights it’s about population composition effect. The red arrow annotation labeled “+25%
Diversity   Benefit”   is   excellent   for   drawing   attention   to   the   performance   gap   favoring   the   mixed

group. This visualization conveys the “counterintuitive benefit” that the text mentions, and the arrow

adds a bit of storytelling to the figure. A couple of improvements:

Like above, put the exact percentages on the bars (e.g. “60%” on the Homogeneous bar, “85%” on

Mixed). This allows the reader to get the numbers even if they don’t read the printout text.

Possibly add a short note in the figure caption or adjacent text clarifying that these numbers are

conceptual. Otherwise a reader might wonder where “85% excellent performance” came from.

Linking it to the idea that mixed groups achieved higher pooled accuracy from the study would suffice.

In terms of overall visual style, the plots are clean with appropriate font sizes and no extraneous elements.
The use of  plt.tight_layout()  ensures nothing overlaps. The interpretability is strong: each figure is

directly tied to one of the key findings and the notebook labels them clearly (5.1, 5.2, etc.) in the markdown.

The integration of textual explanation (either via prints or as suggested, via captions/markdown) with each

figure is what truly makes them effective.

If   the   authors   wanted   to   elevate   the   visualization   aspect   further,   they   could   consider   combining   some

related metrics in a single figure for compactness – for example, overlaying bias and accuracy in one chart

per   agent   (using   a   dual   axis   or   annotations)   –   but   this   can   also   complicate   interpretation.   The   current

approach of one metric per subplot is straightforward and user-friendly.

Finally, ensure the color choices are accessible (red/green should be avoided for colorblind readers, but red/

blue and gold/gray are generally distinguishable). Red and blue are a safe contrasting pair. Given this is an

academic context, adding even a brief figure caption or descriptive title in the markdown (not just on the

axes) could help if someone skims: e.g. “Figure:  Incentives dramatically increase free riders’ participation,

while intrinsic contributors change little.” Captions like this provide takeaways directly on the visuals.

In sum, the visualizations are  well-chosen and generally well-executed. A few tweaks with labeling and

clarifying   metrics   would   make   them   publication-quality.   They   successfully   make   the   notebook’s   insights

more digestible.

## Statistical and Methodological Rigor

From a rigorous standpoint, the notebook is largely a demonstration or didactic summary of known results,

rather than a data-driven analysis or a true simulation. It hard-codes empirical findings (participation rates,
biases, accuracies) into the model, then “uses” them to illustrate outcomes. There is little in the way of

statistical inference or validation happening within the notebook – and improving this would significantly

strengthen it as a research artifact. Key points:

Lack of Data Analysis or Inference: The notebook does not load or analyze any dataset from the

experiments (e.g., no CSV of results, no raw data processing). All numeric values are presumably

taken  from  the  PNAS  article’s  text  or  figures.  While  this  is  acceptable  for  a  conceptual  review,  it

misses an opportunity to show the actual data distribution or perform checks. For example, the

paper reported confidence intervals and p-values (e.g.  free riders’ accuracy higher with P=0.002

).

The   notebook   could   incorporate   those   by   stating   whether   differences   are   statistically   significant

(they are, according to the paper) and perhaps by simulating a small significance test or effect size

calculation.   Mentioning   statistical   significance   or   uncertainty   would   add   rigor   –   currently   the

notebook   presents   point   estimates   as   if   they   are   exact,   which   might   mislead   readers   about

variability.

No Simulation of Mechanisms:  Given the emphasis on cognitive and collective mechanisms, one

might   expect   the   notebook   to   simulate   agent   behavior   to  demonstrate  those   mechanisms.   For

instance,   to   validate   the   “collective   intelligence   emergence”   claim,   the   authors   could   have

constructed   a   simple   simulation:   generate   a   set   of   “intrinsic”   rater   judgments   and   “free   rider”

judgments on some task with known ground truth (using the bias and accuracy parameters), then

show that a combined crowd outperforms an all-intrinsic crowd. This would concretely illustrate the

effect  with  synthetic  data.  Currently,  the  notebook  asserts  the  outcome  (via  a  fixed  85%  vs  60%

difference) without showing a model run. Implementing such a simulation using Memo’s inference

power would greatly enhance methodological rigor – it would turn the notebook from a static recap

into a dynamic verification of the theory. For example, using the Memo DSL, one could model the

rating process as a probabilistic function where free riders and intrinsic agents sample different

error  distributions  (consistent  with  the  given  R²  values),  then  combine  ratings  to  estimate  truth.

Running this model repeatedly could show the distribution of collective accuracy for different group

compositions.

Use of Memo DSL: One of the promises of the Memo DSL (as per the memo_paper.pdf) is the ability

to   handle   recursive   reasoning   and   complex   probability   models   efficiently
.   In   the   current
notebook,   the   Memo   functions   are   essentially   constant   definitions   with   observer:   knows() .

There is no stochastic sampling, conditioning, or inference happening – thus no demonstration of

memo’s capabilities like exact inference or reasoning about agents’ beliefs. In terms of methodology,

this is a missed opportunity. The notebook could be more rigorous by utilizing Memo for what it’s

designed for: e.g., modeling how a “free rider” might  reason about  the reliability of another rater.
Memo’s syntax (like  agent: thinks [...]  or  chooses  statements) could potentially express a

situation   where   agents   weigh   information   differently.   Incorporating   even   a   toy  theory-of-mind

reasoning model (since the narrative claims ToM differences) would elevate the rigor. For instance,
one   could   use   a   @memo   function   to   model   an   agent’s   perception   of   a   rating’s   trustworthiness

depending on whether the source is frequent or selective, and then infer which source is likely more

accurate. This would transform qualitative claims into a testable model output.

Hard-Coding vs. Derivation:  All the key outputs (0.76 vs 0.86 participation, 0.29 vs 0.46 accuracy,

etc.) are directly encoded. A more rigorous approach would derive them from assumptions or lower-

level data. For example, if the paper’s supporting info provides raw counts (which the authors might

have access to), the notebook could compute these percentages rather than assume them. Even

without raw data, one could incorporate the confidence intervals given in the paper into the analysis

(to   show,   say,   free   rider   accuracy   advantage   is   outside   the   margin   of   error).   Right   now,   the

methodology is essentially re-stating results in code form. While this does verify one can represent

the findings in a structured way, it doesn’t  test  them. To be more scientific, the notebook could

frame these numbers as parameters and then explore the model’s behavior when varying them. For

instance,   what   if   the   free   rider   bias   wasn’t   as   high   (say   60%   instead   of   80%)   –   would   they   still

outperform in accuracy? Such an exploration would show robustness of the conclusions. Currently

there is no sensitivity analysis or exploration beyond the baseline values.

Discussion of Limitations: Methodologically, the notebook should acknowledge its own limitations.

It doesn’t mention, for example, that it assumes correlation equals causation. The PNAS study noted

that   free   riders   might   differ   in   unobserved   ways   (they   mention   “free   riders   might   also   be   more
or   that   some   frequent   raters   could   be   gaming   the   system ).   The
rational   or   attentive”

notebook doesn’t address alternative explanations or confounds. A rigorous analysis might discuss

these – perhaps noting that the model assumes  intrinsic  vs  free rider  is an inherent trait and the

causal driver, whereas in reality it could be correlated with other factors. Including such a discussion

(with   references)   would   make   the   notebook   feel   more   like   a   serious   analysis   rather   than   a

promotional demo.

In conclusion, to improve statistical and methodological rigor, the authors should consider incorporating

actual data (or simulated data) and using Memo’s inference abilities to demonstrate the phenomena, rather

than  solely  relying  on  preset  values.  Statistical  measures  (variance,  significance)  should  accompany  any

comparison. By doing so, the notebook would not only tell but show that incentivizing free riders improves

collective intelligence – strengthening the validity of its claims. As it stands, the notebook is accurate but

somewhat  axiomatic: it trusts the paper’s results as given. The next step would be to  reproduce  or  extend

those results with analysis, thereby turning the notebook into a mini research exercise rather than just an

explanatory memo.

## Code Performance and Style

The   code   in   the   notebook   is   relatively   compact   and   readable,   focusing   on   clarity   over   optimization   –

appropriate   given   the   small   scale   of   the   problem.   Here   are   some   observations   and   suggestions   on

performance and style:

Organization and Modularity:  The code is neatly divided into sections with appropriate function
definitions   ( get_participation_rates ,   get_rating_patterns ,   etc.)   that   encapsulate   logic

for each agent type. This is good practice, as it avoids repetition when computing values for Intrinsic
vs Free Rider. The use of the  AgentType  enum makes the code more self-documenting (improving
readability   of   conditions   like   if   agent_type   ==   AgentType.FREE_RIDER ).   Since  Opt-Out  is

defined but not actively used in computations (always returns 0 rates), one could either integrate it

(to   show,   say,   that   including   non-participants   doesn’t   help,   which   the   paper   also   noted

)   or

remove it for simplicity. As a style point, leaving unused code can confuse readers – consider adding

a comment on its purpose, e.g., “# Opt_Out agent type is defined for completeness but not included

in these analyses since they provide no data.”

Use of Memo DSL: The  @memo  decorator usage is syntactically correct, but as noted, each memoized   function   simply   returns   a   constant   after   declaring   observer:   knows() .   In   terms   of

performance, these calls are trivial – they likely compile down to constant values with no overhead.

Memo is designed for more complex operations; using it for constants is harmless but arguably

unnecessary. If the intent is to demonstrate Memo integration, perhaps add a comment in the code

like “# Using Memo functions to store known parameters (could also be simple constants; here we

treat   them   as   observable   model   parameters).”   This   would   signal   to   the   reader   that   we   are

intentionally using Memo and not just doing it out of habit. Performance-wise, there is no issue here

–   a   handful   of   constant   returns   is   instantaneous.   If   more   complex   memo   logic   were   added

(sampling,   recursion),   one   might   need   to   consider   efficiency,   but   memo’s   advantage   is   handling

those efficiently by design

.

Efficiency considerations:  The dataset is tiny (essentially two agent types and a few metrics), so

efficiency is not a concern. All loops are over at most 2 items. The plotting code is fine for this scale.

If the notebook were extended to simulate many agents or trials, one might then leverage NumPy

arrays or Memo’s vectorized inference to speed things up. For example, if simulating 1000 rating

events, using NumPy to generate biases or outcomes would be preferable to Python loops. Right

now,   however,   the   code’s   simplicity   makes   it   quite   fast   already.   There   is   no   indication   of   slow

performance.

Code Style and Pythonic Practices: The code is mostly Pythonic. A few suggestions:

When assembling the  participation_data  and  accuracy_data  lists of dicts for plotting, the

code uses a loop and appends. This is clear and fine. An alternative could be list comprehension or

directly using pandas DataFrames for tabular data, which might simplify plotting (via DataFrame

plotting functions). For example, constructing a DataFrame for participation with columns
agent_type, base_rate, with_incentives  could allow using seaborn or pandas to plot

directly with labeled legends. However, given the small scope, the manual Matplotlib approach is

acceptable and gives more control over aesthetics (as they used).
The f-string formatting is nicely done to format percentages ( :.1% ) and floats ( :.2f ). This makes
the printouts clean. One minor improvement: when printing the R² values, they wrote  R² = 0.46

etc. It might be good to explicitly print the “R²” symbol in the output (maybe via unicode or

superscript), but that's cosmetic. Currently, they use a caret in the markdown text “R²” which appears

correctly.

Adding inline comments to explain non-obvious code lines can help readers. For instance,
observer: knows()  is a Memo-specific idiom; a short comment  # ensure this value is
treated as known (non-random) to the observer  would demystify it. Likewise, explaining
that  wpp  stands for a weighted probability (if it had been used) could help, but since it’s not used

here, that’s moot.

Consistent naming: The code uses lowercase with underscores for function names (PEP8 style) and
uppercase for the enum members, which is good. One inconsistency is that the class  AgentType  is

TitleCase (as a class) – that’s fine by Python convention. All good here.

Printing   and   User   Feedback:  The   notebook   prints   a   header   when   imports   run   (“FREE-RIDER

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE - MEMO COGNITIVE MODEL … Built using proven Memo + Python hybrid

architecture”). This is a nice touch for interactivity, but if this were a script, such printouts might not

be necessary. It doesn’t hinder anything though. The emoji-laden prints give the notebook a report-

like feel. If targeting a more formal audience, those might be toned down, but as a stylistic choice,

it’s subjective. They do serve to clearly mark sections in output.

No Errors or Warnings: Because everything is hard-coded, there’s little room for runtime errors. The

notebook   doesn’t   show   execution   outputs   in   the   text   provided,   but   presumably   it   runs   without

issues. If converting this to a shareable notebook, one should run all cells so that the plots and
printouts appear for someone viewing it. Currently,  execution_count: null  indicates perhaps it

wasn’t executed fully. Ensuring the outputs are saved would improve the presentation.

In summary, the code is clean and straightforward, appropriate for the task. Performance is a non-issue

given the small scale, and the style is mostly consistent and readable. To further improve style: - Include

more comments explaining the memo-specific constructs and the origin of numbers. - Possibly remove or
utilize   the   unused   OPT_OUT   case   to   avoid   confusion.   -   If   aiming   for   a   more   analytical   style,   consider

replacing some prints with assembled results in data frames or tables.

But these are minor. The core logic is sound and easy to follow. The hybrid usage of Memo and Python is

demonstrated (albeit not to its full potential), which might be exactly what the authors intended – to show

that Memo can be embedded in a standard Python workflow. The next step code-wise could be to introduce

a   bit   of   actual   modeling,   but   as   written   the   code   correctly   implements   the   “model”   that   the   authors

described.

## Overall Structure and Coherence as a Research Artifact

Coherence-wise, the notebook is organized in a sensible manner, mirroring a mini research report:

It starts with an introduction and question, then outlines the approach, followed by setup, then a

series of analysis sections (5.1–5.5) each focusing on one aspect of the phenomenon, and finally a

summary of findings and implications. This structure is logical and easy to navigate. Each section

builds on the previous: e.g., participation differences (5.1) feed into understanding why free riders

contribute differently, which relates to bias and accuracy (5.2), which then motivates thinking about

differing   perceptions   (5.3   theory-of-mind),   culminating   in   the   collective   outcome   (5.4)   and   an

integrated picture (5.5).

The narrative coherence is mostly strong: the authors reiterate key points in multiple forms (print

statements, visualizations, and summary bullets), which reinforces the takeaways. The final section

(Implications) nicely lists the key findings 1–4 and the identified mechanisms at individual, social, and

collective levels. This shows the authors have a clear understanding of how the pieces fit together,

and they communicate it in an organized list. It reads almost like the conclusion of a paper, which is

great for a research artifact.

**Areas to improve coherence and scholarly tone**

Integration of Memo Discussion:  Considering the notebook’s title and approach, the role of the

Memo DSL in the analysis is somewhat peripheral in the narrative. The notebook could be more

coherent  in  justifying  why  Memo  is   used   at   all.  In   the  introduction,   it   lists   Memo   as   part  of  the

technical   approach,   but   during   the   analysis,   the   narrative   hardly   references   any  Memo-specific

concept (except implicitly in the Theory-of-Mind section, which wasn’t actually implemented in code).

A reader might finish the notebook and still wonder, “So what did Memo do for us here?” To address

this, the authors could explicitly mention in the text where Memo’s involvement is beneficial. For

example,   after   the   code   cells,   one   might   add:  “By   using   Memo   functions   for   the   key   probabilistic

parameters   (participation   rates,   bias,   accuracy),   we   ensure   these   could   later   be   treated   as   random

variables or conditioned upon if extending the model. In this simple case, they remain fixed, but Memo

provides a framework to expand this analysis to more complex scenarios (e.g., modeling an agent’s belief

update).”  Such a statement would connect the use of Memo to the narrative and future research

directions, making the notebook feel more coherent with its stated methodology. It would also tie in

the memo paper context — perhaps noting that Memo was designed to simplify expressing multi-level
reasoning models, which aligns with the individual/social/collective levels explored here

.

Scholarly Context and Citations:  The notebook ends with a citation of the PNAS paper, which is

good.   It   might   also   cite   the   Memo   paper   or   other   references   if   this   were   a   real   publication.

Coherence   as   a   research   artifact   can   be   boosted   by   showing   awareness   of   related   work.   For

example, one could cite relevant literature for collective intelligence or cognitive biases in crowds

(the PNAS paper itself cites many). Since the focus is narrow, this isn’t strictly necessary, but it can

give  the  notebook  more  credibility.  The  inclusion  of  one  citation  is  a  start;  integrating  reference

notations earlier (when mentioning specific numbers or findings) would be even better.

Implications   and   Future   Work:  The   Implications   section   rightly   lists   what   was   replicated   and

identified. To strengthen it, one might add a few sentences on  “What next?”. For instance,  “These

results suggest system designers should not overly screen out less active contributors; on the contrary,

incentivizing   their   participation   can   improve   outcomes

.   Future   work   could   use   the   Memo-based

cognitive model to explore scenarios like varying incentive magnitudes (as Tchernichovski et al. did in SI) or

introducing different mixes of agent types. Additionally, with Memo, one could extend the theory-of-mind

aspect to formally model how agents’ trust in information sources affects collective decision-making.” This

kind   of   forward-looking   statement   would   show   coherence   in   terms   of   using   the   notebook   as   a

springboard for further research, rather than just an endpoint.

Overall Tone and Presentation:  As a research artifact, the notebook should maintain a balance

between an educational tone and an academic tone. Currently, aspects like the emoji markers and

very short bullet phrases tilt it toward a pedagogical or even promotional style. This is coherent

internally (the style is consistent throughout), but might be seen as less formal. If the goal is an

academic   review,   toning   down   some   casual   elements   and   providing   more   explanatory   text   (as

discussed) would make it feel more like a cohesive scholarly report. If the goal is a teaching demo,

then the style is fine, but then perhaps coherence demands a bit more explanation of concepts for

the student. The authors should clarify (to themselves) the target audience and ensure the tone and

level of detail remain consistent for that audience.

Flow   between   Sections:  One   minor   coherence   issue   is   that   Section   5.3   (Theory-of-Mind

Mechanisms) is somewhat disconnected, because it doesn’t feed directly from a computation – it’s a

conceptual insertion. The notebook jumps from showing data (5.2) to stating theory-of-mind insights

(5.3) and then back to data in 5.4. To make this transition smoother, the authors could introduce 5.3

with a line like:  “Why might free riders be more accurate? One hypothesis is that they and the frequent

raters   differ   in   how   they  perceive   and   value   information.   Below   we   outline   possible   theory-of-mind

differences  that  could  explain  the  bias  and  accuracy  patterns:”.  This  would  link  5.2’s  results  to  5.3’s

content. Similarly, at the end of 5.3, a sentence could bridge to 5.4: “Thus, free riders might selectively

trust   only   high-quality   information   (even   if   it   means   contributing   less   themselves),   whereas   intrinsic

contributors are less discerning. We next examine how these individual-level behaviors translate into the

overall collective performance.”  These small additions would enhance coherence by  explicitly  tying

each section’s idea to the next.

All told, the notebook is  well-structured  and mostly coherent. The suggestions above aim to tighten the

integration of the Memo framework context, ensure each part flows logically into the next, and place the

work in a slightly broader context. By implementing these, the notebook would read as a polished piece of
research   communication:   starting   from   a   question,   grounding   in   literature,   analyzing   with   appropriate

tools, and concluding with insights and future directions. It already has many of these components; refining

the connections between them will make the whole artifact stronger and more impactful.
